🧠 Step 1 – You Are the Client
“First thing—your browser is called a client.
When you open a website, the client asks another computer for data.”
________________________________________
🌐 Step 2 – DNS (Name to Address)
“Computers don’t understand website names like google.com.
They understand numbers called IP addresses.”
“DNS works like the internet’s phonebook—it converts the website name into an IP address.”
________________________________________
📡 Step 3 – Request Goes to Server
“After getting the IP address, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server.”
“It’s like saying—hey server, send me the website.”

🖥️ Step 4 – Server Sends Response
“The server is just a powerful computer that stores website files.”
“It sends back HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.”

🎨 Step 5 – Browser Creates the Website
“Your browser reads the HTML, applies CSS, runs JavaScript…”
“And boom 💥—the website appears on your screen.”

🔐 Bonus – HTTP vs HTTPS
“If the website uses HTTPS, your data is encrypted and secure.”
“That lock icon you see? That’s HTTPS.”

🧠 Summary
“So the full flow is:
Browser → DNS → Server → Response → Browser → Website”
Key Terms to Mention Casually:
•	Client = Browser
•	Server = Computer hosting website
•	DNS = Domain to IP converter
•	HTTP = Communication protocol
•	HTML = Structure
•	CSS = Design
•	JS = Interactivity


Browser → Request → Python Server → HTML → Browser

Real websites use HTTPS and advanced servers, but the concept is exactly the same.

•	80 → HTTP
•	443 → HTTPS
We use 8000 because it’s safe for testing.
 “This Python program is acting as a server”
 “My browser is the client”
 “Browser sends a request”
 “Server sends back HTML”
 “Browser displays the website”
