Servers, Hosting & Domains Explained
Series: How Websites Actually Work
________________________________________
Ever wondered where a website actually lives?
It’s not floating on the internet. It lives on a real computer.
Now let’s understand this step by step.
First, what is a server?
A server is just a computer that is always on and connected to the internet.
Its job is to store website files and send them to users when requested.
When someone opens your website, their browser sends a request to the server, and the server sends back the website files.
Now what is hosting?
Hosting is basically renting space on a server.
Instead of using your personal laptop to run a website 24/7, you pay a company to host your website on their powerful servers.
These hosting companies make sure your website stays online all the time.
Now let’s understand domain names.
A domain name is the address of your website.
For example, google.com is a domain name.
Without a domain, users would have to remember a long IP address.
So domain names make websites easy to access.
Here’s how everything connects.
Domain name points to the server’s IP address.
The server stores your website.
Hosting keeps that server running.
And users access your website through the domain.
So the complete flow looks like this in simple words:
User types domain → Domain connects to server → Server sends website → Website loads.
Now let’s understand types of hosting quickly.
Shared hosting means your website shares a server with many other websites.
VPS hosting gives you a dedicated portion of a server.
Cloud hosting uses multiple connected servers for better reliability.
Summary:
Server stores your website.
Hosting keeps it online.
Domain makes it easy to access.
